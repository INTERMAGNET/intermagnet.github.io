## INTERMAGNET Data Portal Moving

The host for the INTERMAGNET data portal has moved from Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to the  British Geological Survey (BGS). The service at BGS includes all INTERMAGNET data previously available from NRCan - the data has been copied between the two GINs.

The way you access data via the new services at BGS differs from how you have accessed data in the past using the services provided by NRCan. The following facilities are available:

- A data visualisation and download web site: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2)
- A description of the INTERMAGNET data access web service: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/)
- A HAPI web service interface to INTERMAGNET data:
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/hapi](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/hapi).
  For information about HAPI see [https://hapi-server.org/](https://hapi-server.org/).
- An ftp service: imag-ftp.bgs.ac.uk
  
We encourage you to use the web services in preference to the ftp service. It will become increasingly difficult to access ftp servers in the future – support for ftp in web browsers has already been largely withdrawn. INTERMAGNET is likely to withdraw the ftp service in the future.
