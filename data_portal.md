 title: INTERMAGNET Data Portal
---

View INTERMAGNET data here: [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2).

The INTERMAGNET data portal is hosted at the British Geological Survey (BGS). The service includes access to all INTERMAGNET provisonal and definitive data. 

The data portal offers a number of services:

- A data visualisation and download web site: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINForms2)
- A description of the INTERMAGNET data access web service: 
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/)
- A HAPI web service interface to INTERMAGNET data:
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/hapi](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/hapi).
  For information about HAPI see [https://hapi-server.org/](https://hapi-server.org/).
- Statistics on how data is used, how complete data provision is and the timeliness of data provided to INTERMAGNET:
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINStatistics](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINStatistics)
- Access to data from observatories that are testing their data connection with INTERMAGNET (these data may not be observatory quality - you should check with the data provider before using these data):
  [https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINTest2](https://imag-data.bgs.ac.uk/GIN_V1/GINTest2)
- An ftp service: imag-ftp.bgs.ac.uk
  
We encourage you to use the web services in preference to the ftp service. It will become increasingly difficult to access ftp servers in the future â€“ support for ftp in web browsers has already been largely withdrawn. INTERMAGNET is likely to withdraw the ftp service in the future.
